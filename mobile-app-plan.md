# MeatGeek Mobile App - React Native Implementation Plan

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the comprehensive plan for developing a React Native iOS mobile application for the MeatGeek BBQ platform. The app will integrate with the existing Sessions API to provide users with real-time cooking session management, temperature monitoring, and historical cook tracking. The initial MVP will focus exclusively on iOS/iPad devices using the Infinite Red Ignite boilerplate for rapid development.

## Project Overview

### Core Objectives
- Create an elegant iOS app for BBQ cooking session management
- Integrate seamlessly with the existing MeatGeek Sessions API
- Provide real-time temperature monitoring and session control
- Deliver a premium user experience following Apple Design Guidelines
- Implement robust offline capabilities and resilient API communication

### Technology Stack
- **Framework**: React Native 0.79+ with TypeScript
- **Boilerplate**: Infinite Red Ignite
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for API state, MMKV for local persistence
- **Build System**: Nx integration for monorepo consistency
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions with Fastlane for iOS deployment
- **Testing**: Maestro for E2E testing, Jest for unit tests

## Architecture Overview

### State Management Strategy
We'll replace Ignite's default MobX-State-Tree with TanStack Query to provide:
- Automatic retry logic with exponential backoff
- Optimistic updates for better UX
- Background data synchronization
- Intelligent caching with stale-while-revalidate patterns
- Built-in error handling and loading states

### API Integration Layer
- **Base URL**: `https://meatgeeksessionsapi.azurewebsites.net/api/sessions/{smokerId}`
- **Retry Strategy**: Exponential backoff (2^attempt * 1000ms) with max 3 retries
- **Error Handling**: Global error boundaries with contextual user feedback
- **Offline Support**: Queue mutations when offline, sync when connection restored
- **Security**: Environment variables for API keys and endpoints

### Data Flow
1. **API Layer** → TanStack Query → **React Components**
2. **Local Storage** ← MMKV ← **Settings & Cache**
3. **Real-time Updates** → Polling/WebSocket → **Live Temperature Data**

## Screen Designs & User Experience

### 1. Active Cook Screen (Home/Dashboard)
The primary screen displays the current cooking session with large, easy-to-read temperature gauges for each probe and the grill chamber. Users can see elapsed cook time, target temperatures, and receive visual alerts when temperatures reach set points. The interface features smooth animations for temperature changes and prominent controls for adjusting target temperatures. This screen serves as the command center during active cooking sessions with haptic feedback for all interactions.

### 2. Start Cook Screen (Session Setup)
A clean, wizard-style interface guides users through setting up a new cooking session with sections for selecting the protein type, setting target temperatures for each probe, and configuring cook duration estimates. The screen features elegant input controls with iOS-native pickers and sliders for temperature selection. Users can save common configurations as presets for quick session starts. The interface emphasizes clarity with progressive disclosure to avoid overwhelming new users while providing advanced options for experienced pitmasters.

### 3. Cook History Screen (Past Sessions)
A scrollable list view displays previous cooking sessions with thumbnail summaries showing the protein type, cook duration, and peak temperatures achieved. Each entry includes visual indicators for successful vs. problematic cooks using subtle color coding and iconography. Users can search and filter by date range, protein type, or cook rating. The interface follows iOS list design patterns with swipe actions for quick operations like sharing cook details or marking favorites.

### 4. Cook Details Screen (Historical Analysis)
A comprehensive view of completed cooking sessions featuring interactive temperature charts with zoom capabilities and probe-specific data visualization. The screen displays cook statistics including average temperatures, time at target, and efficiency metrics with smooth animated transitions between different chart views. Users can add notes, photos, and ratings to document their cooking experience. The interface emphasizes data storytelling with clear visual hierarchy and Apple-inspired chart designs.

### 5. Settings Screen (Configuration & Preferences)
A standard iOS settings interface for configuring app preferences, notification settings, and device management options. Users can manage multiple smoker devices, set default temperature units (Fahrenheit/Celsius), and configure alert thresholds. The screen includes sections for account preferences, data export options, and app information. The design follows iOS Settings app conventions with grouped sections and familiar interaction patterns.
